```{r setup}

options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores(logical=FALSE))
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file())
setwd(rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file())
```

good modeler practice :

within the function, make sure you write the attributes

```{r}
v <- seq(from = 1, to = 4, by = 1)
```

What is a R object?
